# Network Flow Simulator
By Mario Susanto

The Network Flow Simulator is a website intended to provide users with the ability to easily create network flow graphs by placing nodes and drawing edges between them. Each node has a demand, where negative valeus represent the inflow and positive values represent the outflow. Meanwhile, the values of edges are represented in the form of lowerBound/flow/capacity (eg an edge of 1/4/5 requires between 1 to 5 flow, and currently has 4 flow going through it). When demand is fulfilled, the colour of the node turns green.
